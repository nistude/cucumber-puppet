Feature: Test cucumber-puppet against various Puppet releases
  In order to support a broad user base
  As a developer of cucumber-puppet
  I want cucumber-puppet to properly work with various Puppet releases

  @puppet_version
  Scenario Outline: Test specific Puppet version
    Given an initialized directory tree for puppet version "<version>"
    When I generate "testcase"
    Then cucumber-puppet should successfully run "features"

    Examples:
      | version |
      | 0.24.8  |
      | 0.24.9  |
      | 0.25.0  |
      | 0.25.1  |
      | 0.25.2  |
      | 0.25.3  |
      | 0.25.4  |
      | 0.25.5  |
      | 2.6.0   |
      | 2.6.1   |
      | 2.6.2   |
      | 2.6.3   |
      | 2.6.4   |
      | 2.6.11  |
      | 2.6.12  |

  @puppet_version
  Scenario Outline: Test specific Puppet version
    Given an initialized directory tree for puppet version "<version>"
    When I generate "parameterized_testcase"
    Then cucumber-puppet should successfully run "features"

    Examples:
      | version |
      | 2.6.5   |
      | 2.6.6   |
      | 2.6.7   |
      | 2.6.8   |
      | 2.6.9   |
      | 2.6.11  |
      | 2.6.12  |
      | 2.7.1   |
      | 2.7.3   |
